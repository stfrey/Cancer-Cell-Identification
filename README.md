## Executive Summary
Cancer cell identification is commonly performed through visually analyzing tissue slides, which them selves are extremely complex, large files. Generally, doctors often look for abnomrally shaped cells, different arrangement than the surrounding tissue, and larger nuclei to identify cancerous cells [1]. To mimic this analysis, I trained a Convolutional Neural Network to identify these abnormally shaped cells and label the slide as non-cancerous or cancerous. I ensured the difference in cells would not be a factor by using kaggle competition data of the same cancer cells [2], and followed by a multi-classification problem of two cancer cells from lung tissue slides [3].
